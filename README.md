# atlas_docs

Hey all!  
My name is Emre, I am a BSc Computer Science student at the University of Exeter.  
Over the past year, I have found myself googling the same questions again and again, so I have decided to create a repository of information on the tools I use.  
This "documentation" page is meant to be for students like me, who want a reference for how to correctly go about installing, updating and maintaining these tools.  
This repo is a WIP. Feel free to let me know about any feedback, or submit a pull request. I am happy to listen. I hope you find it helpful!
